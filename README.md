# Transfer Learning project 

---

# Project Overview
# This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning using MobileNetV3 on Fashion-MNIST.
# MobileNetV3 is a lightweight CNN designed for efficiency. The dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items.

## Steps

# Load the Fashion-MNIST Dataset
# Use torchvision to download and preprocess the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets.

# Define the Model
# Leverage the pre-trained MobileNetV3 architecture available in PyTorch.
# Modify the classifier head to match the 10 classes of Fashion-MNIST.

# Train the Model
# Fine-tune the pre-trained weights on the Fashion-MNIST training set.
# Use an optimizer like Adam and a loss function such as CrossEntropyLoss.
# Include data augmentation for better generalization.

# Evaluate the Model
# Test the model on the Fashion-MNIST test set and measure accuracy and loss metrics.

## Requirements

# Python 3.8+
# PyTorch
# torchvision
# NumPy
# Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
